i have a ton of good icons images with their canny and soft edge counterpart.
they also have a very detailed prompt.

i want to change this instruct-pix2pix training script to take the canny or soft edge as input image, the detailed text prompt, and give back the proper image like it is in the dataset.


i need to use this model instead of stable diffusion by runwayml

which is better for stylized input icons 
Yes, it’s absolutely possible to adapt this InstructPix2Pix training script to the scenario where:


Your “original image” is the canny or soft-edge image
Your “edited image” is the full/real icon image
Your “edit_prompt” is the detailed text describing the icon
Essentially, you will be training a model that goes from (canny/soft-edge + prompt) → (final image).

1. High-Level What You Need to Change
Dataset Columns

In the script, the default column names are:
--original_image_column (defaults to "input_image")
--edit_prompt_column (defaults to "edit_prompt")
--edited_image_column (defaults to "edited_image")
In your case, you want:
original_image_column → The canny/soft edge image
edit_prompt_column → The text prompt describing the icon
edited_image_column → The final “real” icon image
You do not have to rename your actual dataset files. You can just tell the script which columns in your dataset correspond to these three roles, by passing --original_image_column MY_CANNY_COLUMN_NAME etc.
Remove or Update the “DATASET_NAME_MAPPING” (or just ignore it)

The script tries to do an automatic guess of columns via DATASET_NAME_MAPPING. Just explicitly pass your own column names on the command line (e.g., --original_image_column canny_image --edited_image_column real_image --edit_prompt_column text_prompt) and you can ignore DATASET_NAME_MAPPING entirely.
Optional: Adjust Transforms / Augmentations

The script does random crops (RandomCrop), center crops (CenterCrop), or random horizontal flips. Depending on your dataset (e.g. icons might be small or carefully aligned), you may or may not want these random transformations. You can remove or adjust them in:
python
Copy
train_transforms = transforms.Compose(
    [
        transforms.CenterCrop(args.resolution) if args.center_crop else transforms.RandomCrop(args.resolution),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip() if args.random_flip else transforms.Lambda(lambda x: x),
    ]
)
If you’d prefer no random flip or no random crop, just comment them out or remove them.
Everything Else Can Stay the Same

The actual training loop (forward diffusion + denoising + the instruct-pix2pix “concatenate the input image latents with the noisy latents”) does not care if the “original_image” is a canny map or a photograph. It just treats it as the input image to condition on.
2. Steps to Use Your Custom Dataset
Let’s suppose your dataset has columns:

"edge_image" (the canny/soft-edge)
"final_image" (the real icon)
"icon_prompt" (the text description/prompt)
Then you could run:

bash
Copy
python train_instruct_pix2pix.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path="runwayml/stable-diffusion-instructpix2pix" \
  --train_data_dir="/path/to/your/images" \
  --original_image_column="edge_image" \
  --edit_prompt_column="icon_prompt" \
  --edited_image_column="final_image" \
  --resolution=256 \
  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --gradient_checkpointing \
  --max_train_steps=1000 \
  --conditioning_dropout_prob=0.1 \
  --output_dir="my_instructpix2pix_edges_model"
Adjust flags (like --num_train_epochs, --learning_rate, etc.) as you need.

3. About GPU Requirements
Minimum VRAM: Realistically, fine-tuning any diffusion model (Stable Diffusion sized) generally benefits from at least 8GB GPU memory if you want a decent batch size.
Gradient checkpointing (the --gradient_checkpointing flag).
Possibly accelerate CPU offload or flash-attention / xFormers (the script already has a flag --enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention).


4. Summary of Code Edits
Pass your custom columns:
python
Copy
parser.add_argument(
    "--original_image_column",
    type=str,
    default="edge_image",
)
parser.add_argument(
    "--edited_image_column",
    type=str,
    default="final_image",
)
parser.add_argument(
    "--edit_prompt_column",
    type=str,
    default="icon_prompt",
)
Rename or drop DATASET_NAME_MAPPING so it doesn’t auto-override.
In the transform (under preprocess_train), it’s the same logic. The script will read your edge_image, your final_image, do random crops/flips if you left them on, and produce original_pixel_values (the edge) and edited_pixel_values (the real icon).
Everything else can remain exactly the same because the instruct-pix2pix architecture only cares that it sees:
A conditioning image (original/canny in your use-case).
A final target image (the real icon).
An edit prompt (the textual description/instruction).
Final Thoughts
Yes, it’s quite straightforward to adapt this script for a “canny/edge → final image” dataset. Just specify the dataset columns so that the code knows “which is the input image, which is the target image, and which is the prompt.”
